# Machine Learning Final Project - Zewailcity

## Overview
This project is the final assignment for the Machine Learning Course at Zewailcity. It consists of two major tasks:

1. **Fraudulent Card Transaction Classification**
   - The goal is to classify fraudulent credit card transactions so that they are automatically rejected and reported to the bank and authorities.
   
2. **Loan Risk Prediction**
   - This task involves predicting the risk level of requested loans based on customer data.
   - The final decision determines whether a loan is accepted or rejected.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two Jupyter notebooks:
- **ML_Phase2_Classification_Credit_Cards.ipynb**: Implements a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **ML_Phase2_Regression_Loans.ipynb**: Implements a predictive model to assess loan risks.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run each notebook in the provided order.

## Status
This project is still undergoing development, and improvements are expected in both accuracy and efficiency. Further optimization and feature engineering will be explored in future iterations.
