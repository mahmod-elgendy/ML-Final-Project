# Machine Learning Final Project - Fraud Detection & Loan Risk Prediction

## Description
This project is the final submission for the Machine Learning course at Zewailcity. It consists of two main parts:

1. **Fraud Card Transaction Classification**: The goal is to classify fraudulent credit card transactions so that they can be automatically rejected and reported to the bank and authorities.
2. **Loan Risk Prediction**: This part involves predicting the risk rate for requested loans based on customer data, ultimately determining whether a loan should be accepted or rejected.

## Project Status
This project is **finalized** and was developed as part of the course requirements.

## Authors
- Mahmoud Elgendy

## Files Included
- `ML_Phase2_Classification_Credit_Cards.ipynb` - Contains the classification model for fraud detection.
- `ML_Phase2_Regression_Loans.ipynb` - Contains the regression-based loan risk prediction model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the cells in each notebook sequentially to see the analysis and predictions.

## Acknowledgments
